Usage
Product Management
Add Products: Products like different bike models can be added to the database via MongoDB or API. Each product includes details like name, type, price, and available stock.

Order Placement: Customers can place orders via the POST /api/orders API endpoint, specifying the product and quantity.

Revenue Calculation
Use the GET /api/orders/revenue endpoint to calculate the total revenue generated from all placed orders. The system will compute this by multiplying the product price by the ordered quantity and summing up the values across all orders.
